Hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we caught up, and I was thinking it's high time we grab a coffee and chat about life. How about we meet up this week? I found this cozy new coffee spot downtown that I've been dying to try.

Let me know what day works for you, and we can make it happen. Looking forward to some good laughs and catching up!
